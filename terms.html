						<h3>COVID-19 Policy</h3>
						<p><b>During the COVID-19 pandemic period, our salon will follow all state and federal guidelines with a few additional safety measures. This includes 
						<ul><li>Wearing facemask at all time while inside</li>
						<li>Keeping distance with other customers at least 6 feet apart</li>
						<li>No-contact temperature check prior to entering the spa</li>
						<li>Signing the <a href="https://preciousnailspaleesburg.com/#/consent" >consent form</a> for every visit prior to receiving service.</li></ul>
						
						No walk-in will be accepted. If you have an appointment, as you arrive, please remain in your vehicle and check-in by filling out the <a href="https://preciousnailspaleesburg.com/#/consent" >consent form</a>. This will notify us of your arrival. We will then perform a temperature check and escort you in. 
						</b></p>
						 
						<h3>Arrival Time</h3>
						<p>In order to have the best experience, we invite clients to arrive 10 minutes early for bookings to ensure there is plenty of time to check in, use the bathroom, fill out any necessary forms and choose from the vast range of colours available. As a courtesy to all our clients a prompt appointment schedule is adhered to, late appointments may not be honoured. Treatments begun late will be shortened in consideration of the next client.</p>
						<h3>Prices</h3>
						<p>All prices are subject to change without notice.</p>
						<h3>Cancellation Policy</h3>
						<p>At Precious Nail Spa we have a strict 24 hour cancellation policy in order to accommodate the high demand of appointments. This policy applies across the board whether booked in person, on the phone, via email or online through our website or app. We are happy to cancel or reschedule appointments, providing we have at least 24 hours notice. For the avoidance of doubt failure to notify Precious Nail Spa within 24 hours will result in the loss of the appointment and 100% cancellation fee or loss of a bundle item. No refunds will be given to cancelled or rescheduled bookings. Bookings with less than 24 hours notice will not be downgraded and the full value at time of booking is payable. Clients arriving more than ten minutes late for their appointments will risk loosing their appointment and being charged in full. Please note in the event of a late arrival, we may not be able to carry out the complete treatment, you will however be charged for the full value of the treatment that was made at time of booking. A no-show and repeat cancellations are required by the system to then only book via our app.</p>
						<h3>Group Bookings</h3>
						<p>Groups of 3 or more will require a 50% deposit made via Venmo. An invoice will be sent for the booking and once the deposit is settled the booking will be made. We will require 48 hours in order to change or cancel the booking and deposits are calculated according to each treatment.</p>
						<h3>Gift Vouchers</h3>
						<p>If paying with a gift voucher you must give details at time of booking. Gift vouchers must be presented at reception upon arrival for the booked treatment. Failure to attend an appointment will result in full or partial payment for your visit to be deducted from your gift voucher. We will however honour the remaining balance of the voucher for future use.<br />
						Gift vouchers are valid for a period of 12 months. Precious Nail Spa will not accept responsibility for lost, stolen or damaged gift vouchers.<br />
						Gift vouchers may not be exchanged for cash or other vouchers. Change will not be given, but the balance will remain on the voucher until its expiry date.</p>
						<h3>Lost Property</h3>
						<p>We ask clients to look after their property while at Precious Nail Spa as we are unable to take responsibility of items left unattended. Please note bag clips are available for use.</p>
						<h3>Nail Aftercare Service</h3>
						<p>In the event you chip your nails within three days after lacquering (four days for gel polish), please report this with a photo to preciousnailspaleesburg@gmail.com and we will offer you a free touch-up on the effected nails within seven days. Outside this period there will be a small fee.</p>
